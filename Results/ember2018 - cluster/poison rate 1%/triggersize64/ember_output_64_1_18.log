mkdir -p failed for path /home/students/nicola.modugno2/.config/matplotlib: [Errno 122] Disk quota exceeded: '/home/students/nicola.modugno2/.config'
Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-jzc_vd9g because there was an issue with the default path (/home/students/nicola.modugno2/.config/matplotlib); it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.

[*] Step 1: Feature selection with SHAP

=== Trigger Feature Selection (SHAP-based - EFFICIENT) ===
   Using REDUCED sample size for memory efficiency
   Samples to explain: 100
   Background samples: 50

[*] Computing SHAP values...
    This will take ~5-10 minutes with 2279 features
    DeepExplainer failed: tuple index out of range
    Falling back to GradientExplainer...
    GradientExplainer also failed: too many indices for tensor of dimension 1
    Falling back to KernelExplainer with tiny sample...
    Used TINY KernelExplainer (may be less accurate)

 Selected 64 features for trigger

[+] Modello backdoor salvato: model_backdoored.pth
[+] Trigger salvato: backdoor_trigger.npy

[*] Step 5: Testing backdoor on malware

[*] Inserted trigger in 100000 malware samples

[*] Step 6: Evaluating attack effectiveness

  Malware samples: 100000
    Original labels: (array([1.], dtype=float32), array([100000]))

===  Backdoor Attack Evaluation ===
Acc(F_b, X):   0.6198  (clean test set - should stay high)
Acc(F_b, X_b): 0.0073  (backdoored malware - should drop)
ASR:           0.9928  (attack success rate - higher is better)

Interpretation:
  ✓ Clean acc ~61.98%: Model still works on normal data
  ✓ ASR 99.28%: 99.3% of backdoored malware evades detection

 COMPARISON WITH PAPER RESULTS (Severi et al.)
================================================================================
  No paper results for 64 features on EmberNN

 Note: Exact comparison difficult due to:
   - Different hardware/implementation
   - Random seed differences
   - SHAP approximation variations

 Key Metrics:
  Clean Model Accuracy:     0.7462
  Backdoor Model Accuracy:  0.7015
  Attack Success Rate:      0.9928

 Next Steps:
  1. Analizza backdoor_experiment_results.json
  2. Confronta con Table 6 del paper (LargeAbsSHAP x CountAbsSHAP)
  3. Valuta l'efficacia delle tue defense vs Isolation Forest
  4. Considera di testare con trigger_size diversi (8, 16, 32, 128)

mkdir -p failed for path /home/students/nicola.modugno2/.config/matplotlib: [Errno 122] Disk quota exceeded: '/home/students/nicola.modugno2/.config'
Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-x7mxpznq because there was an issue with the default path (/home/students/nicola.modugno2/.config/matplotlib); it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.

[*] Step 6: Evaluating attack effectiveness

  Malware samples: 100000

===  Backdoor Attack Evaluation ===
Acc(F_b, X):   0.5173  (clean test set - should stay high)
Acc(F_b, X_b): 0.0017  (backdoored malware - should drop)
ASR:           0.9983  (attack success rate - higher is better)

Interpretation:
  ✓ Clean acc ~51.73%: Model still works on normal data
  ✓ ASR 99.83%: 99.8% of backdoored malware evades detection

  Δ Acc(F_b, X_b): -0.2087
  ✓ Your attack is MORE effective!

 Note: Exact comparison difficult due to:
   - Different hardware/implementation
   - Random seed differences
   - SHAP approximation variations
